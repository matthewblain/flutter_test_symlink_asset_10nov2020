# flutter_test_symlink_asset_10nov2020

This is a test of flutter and assets and symlinks and Windows.
It'll start with the basic project created by Android Studio.
Then I'll add a very simple usage of an asset.
Then I'll move the asset to a symlink.

It should work perfectly everywhere, but on Windows there may be trouble.
